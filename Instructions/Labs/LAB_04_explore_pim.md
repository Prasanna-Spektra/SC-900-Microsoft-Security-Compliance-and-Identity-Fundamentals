# Lab: Explore identity governance in Azure AD with Privileged Identity management.

## Lab scenario
In this lab, you will explore some of the basic functionality of Privileged Identity Management (PIM). PIM does require Azure AD Premium P2.  In this lab, you, as the admin, will configure one of your users, Diego Siciliani, with an Azure AD user administrator role, through Privileged ID management (PIM).   With user admin privileges, Diego will be able to create users and groups manage licenses and more.  Both the admin and the user, Diego, must be configured for the Azure AD Premium P2 license.

**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

#### Task 1: In this task, you, as the admin, will reset the password for the user Diego Siciliani. This step is needed so you can initially sign in as the user in subsequent tasks.

1. Open Microsoft Edge.  In the address bar enter **portal.azure.com**.

2. Sign in with the credentials provided in the **Environment Details** Tab. 
    1. In the Sign in window enter **odl_user_xxxxx@xxxxx.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxxxx is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab
    1. Enter the admin password which should be provided by your lab hosting provider. Select **Sign in**.
    1. When prompted to stay signed- in, select **Yes**.

3. Select **Azure Active Directory**.  

4. From the left navigation panel select **Users**.

5. Select **Diego Siciliani** from the list of users.

6. Select **Reset password** from the top of the page. Since you have not previously signed in as Diego you don’t know his password and will need to reset the password.

7. When the password reset window opens, select **Reset Password**.  IMPORTANT, make a note of the new password, as you will need it in a subsequent task, to be able to sign in as the user.

14. In the Assignment start fields, keep the default date and time, which are today and the current time.

15. In the Assignment end fields, change the date to today’s date (note the default setting is one year from today, so you need to change the year). For the time, set the time to two hours from the current time.  After you have set the time field for the time when the Assignment ends, press the tab key on your keyboard and select **Assign** at the bottom of the page.

   ![](../Images/click-to-continue.png)

1. You are notified that more information is required, select **Next**.
1. Enter your password, **SC900-Lab**.

#### Review
In this lab; you explored PIM.  You, as the admin, configured Diego with user admin privileges for a specified amount of time.  Then you, as Diego, walked through the process of activating the user admin privileges and configuring user settings.  Recall that PIM requires an Azure AD Premium P2 license.
